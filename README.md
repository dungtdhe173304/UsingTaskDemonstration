In most cases, PLINQ performs much faster than its non-parallel counterpart LINQ. However, there is some performance overhead, which is related to partitioning and merging while parallelizing the LINQ. The following are some of the things we need to consider while using PLINQ:
Parallel is not always faster: Parallelization is an overhead. Unless our source collection is huge or it has compute-bound operations, it makes more sense to execute the perations in sequence. Always measure the performance of sequential and parallel queries to make an informed decision
Avoid I/O operations that involve atomicity: All I/O operations that involve writing to a filesystem, database, network, or shared memory location should be avoided inside PLINQ. This is because these methods are not thread-safe, so using them may lead to exceptions. A solution would be to use synchronization primitives, but this would also reduce performance drastically
Queries may not always be running in parallel: Parallelization in PLINQ is a decision that's taken by Core CLR. Even if we called the AsParallel() method in the query, it isn't guaranteed to take a parallel path and may run sequentially instead
